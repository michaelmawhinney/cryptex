# Cryptex Documentation

Generated documentation for Cryptex is [available online](https://michaelmawhinney.github.io/cryptex/), and is regenerated automatically whenever changes are made.

Pre-built documentation is not provided in this repo, but you can generate it by running `phpdoc` in the top-level folder of this project, and documentation will be generated in this `docs` folder. You will need to have [phpDocumentor](https://www.phpdoc.org) installed.

Further information is available in [the Cryptex README](https://github.com/michaelmawhinney/cryptex/blob/master/README.md).
